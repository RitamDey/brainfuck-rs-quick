[â†’ See simple implementation][simple]

**Note:** this is currently a work in progress

---

A quick [brainfuck][brainfuck] interpreter implemented in the [Rust][rust] language.

This implementation is focussed on being as quick as possible.
This is my approach of building a quick interpreter, I'm sure there are quicker
interpreters out there.
